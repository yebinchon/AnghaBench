  ** found that many systems do not have a working isnan() function so
  ** this implementation is provided as an alternative.
  **
  ** This NaN test sometimes fails if compiled on GCC with -ffast-math.
  ** On the other hand, the use of -ffast-math comes with the following
  ** warning:
  **
  **      This option [-ffast-math] should never be turned on by any
  **      -O option since it can result in incorrect output for programs
  **      which depend on an exact implementation of IEEE or ISO 
  **      rules/specifications for math functions.
  **
  ** Under MSVC, this NaN test may fail if compiled with a floating-
  ** point precision mode other than /fp:precise.  From the MSDN 
  ** documentation:
  **
  **      The compiler [with /fp:precise] will properly handle comparisons 
  **      involving NaN. For example, x != x evaluates to true if x is NaN 
  **      ...
