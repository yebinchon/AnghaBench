  /* Following an incremental-merge operation, assuming that the input
  ** segments are not completely consumed (the usual case), they are updated
  ** in place to remove the entries that have already been merged. This
  ** involves updating the leaf block that contains the smallest unmerged
  ** entry and each block (if any) between the leaf and the root node. So
  ** if the height of the input segment b-trees is N, and input segments
  ** are merged eight at a time, updating the input segments at the end
  ** of an incremental-merge requires writing (8*(1+N)) blocks. N is usually
  ** small - often between 0 and 2. So the overhead of the incremental
  ** merge is somewhere between 8 and 24 blocks. To avoid this overhead
  ** dwarfing the actual productive work accomplished, the incremental merge
  ** is only attempted if it will write at least 64 leaf blocks. Hence
  ** nMinMerge.
  **
  ** Of course, updating the input segments also involves deleting a bunch
  ** of blocks from the segments table. But this is not considered overhead
  ** as it would also be required by a crisis-merge that used the same input 
  ** segments.
