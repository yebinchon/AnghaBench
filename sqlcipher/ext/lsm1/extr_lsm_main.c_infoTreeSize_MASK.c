  **     is atomic - that it is not possible to read a partially written
  **     garbage value. However the two values may be mutually inconsistent. 
  **
  **   * TreeHeader.iLogOff is a 64-bit value. And lsmCheckpointLogOffset()
  **     reads a 64-bit value from a snapshot stored in shared memory. It
  **     is assumed that in each case it is possible to read a partially
  **     written garbage value. If this occurs, then the value returned
  **     for the size of the "old" tree may reflect the size of an "old"
  **     tree that was recently flushed to disk.
  **
  ** Given the context in which this function is called (as a result of an
  ** lsm_info(LSM_INFO_TREE_SIZE) request), neither of these are considered to
  ** be problems.
