  **
  **   * If the exclusive shm WRITER or READ0 lock cannot be obtained,
  **     the checkpoint fails with SQLITE_BUSY (normally SQLite would
  **     proceed with running a passive checkpoint instead of failing).
  **
  **   * Attempts to read from the *-wal file or write to the database file
  **     do not perform any IO. Instead, the frame/page combinations that
  **     would be read/written are recorded in the sqlite3rbu.aFrame[]
  **     array.
  **
  **   * Calls to xShmLock(UNLOCK) to release the exclusive shm WRITER, 
  **     READ0 and CHECKPOINT locks taken as part of the checkpoint are
  **     no-ops. These locks will not be released until the connection
  **     is closed.
  **
  **   * Attempting to xSync() the database file causes an SQLITE_INTERNAL 
  **     error.
  **
  ** As a result, unless an error (i.e. OOM or SQLITE_BUSY) occurs, the
  ** checkpoint below fails with SQLITE_INTERNAL, and leaves the aFrame[]
  ** array populated with a set of (frame -> page) mappings. Because the 
  ** WRITER, CHECKPOINT and READ0 locks are still held, it is safe to copy 
  ** data from the wal file into the database file according to the 
  ** contents of aFrame[].
