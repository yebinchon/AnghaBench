	// The original code gave a preference for the vup vector to start out as (0, 0, 1), unless the
	// normal had a dominant Z value, in which case vup started out as (1, 0, 0).  After that, vup
	// was "bent" [along the plane defined by normal and vup] to become perpendicular to normal.
	// After that the vright vector was computed as the cross product of vup and normal.

	// I'm constructing the winding polygon points in a fashion similar to the method used in the
	// original function.  Orientation is the same.  The size of the winding polygon, however, is
	// variable in this function (depending on the angle of normal), and is larger (by about a factor
	// of 2) than the winding polygon in the original function.

	// not exceeding 1.0.  The minimum length that vright can achieve happens when,
	// for example, the Z and X components of the normal input vector are equal,
	// and when normal's Y component is zero.  In that case Z and X of the normal
	// vector are both approximately 0.70711.  The resulting vright vector in this

	// org is now a point on the plane defined by normal and dist.  Furthermore,
	// org, vright, and vup are pairwise perpendicular.  Now, the 4 vectors
	// { (+-)vright + (+-)vup } have length that is at least sqrt(185364^2 + 185364^2),
	// which is about 262144.  That length lies outside the world, since the furthest
	// point in the world has distance 113512 from the origin as mentioned above.
	// Also, these 4 vectors are perpendicular to the org vector.  So adding them
	// to org will only increase their length.  Therefore the 4 points defined below
	// all lie outside of the world.  Furthermore, it can be easily seen that the
	// edges connecting these 4 points (in the winding_accu_t below) lie completely
	// outside the world.  sqrt(262144^2 + 262144^2)/2 = 185363, which is greater than
