	// TODO: Rambetter has some serious comments here as well.  First off,
	// in the case where a normal is non-axial, there is nothing special
	// about integer distances.  I would think that snapping a distance might
	// make sense for axial normals, but I'm not so sure about snapping
	// non-axial normals.  A shift by 0.01 in a plane, multiplied by a clipping
	// against another plane that is 5 degrees off, and we introduce 0.1 error
	// easily.  A 0.1 error in a vertex is where problems start to happen, such
	// as disappearing triangles.

	// Second, assuming we have snapped the normal above, let's say that the
	// plane we just snapped was defined for some points that are actually
	// quite far away from normal * dist.  Well, snapping the normal in this
	// case means that we've just moved those points by potentially many units!
	// Therefore, if we are going to snap the normal, we need to know the
	// points we're snapping for so that the plane snaps with those points in
	// mind (points remain close to the plane).

	// I would like to know exactly which problems SnapPlane() is trying to
	// solve so that we can better engineer it (I'm not saying that SnapPlane()
	// should be removed altogether).  Fix all this snapping code at some point!
