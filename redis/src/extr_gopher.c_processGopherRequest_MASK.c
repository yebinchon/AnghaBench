     *
     * 1. Clients should not have any issue with missing .<CR><LF> as for
     *    specification, and in the real world indeed certain servers
     *    implementations never used to send the terminator.
     *
     * 2. Redis does not know if it's serving a text file or a binary file:
     *    at the same time clients will not remove the ".<CR><LF>" bytes at
     *    tne end when downloading a binary file from the server, so adding
     *    the "Lastline" terminator without knowing the content is just
     *    dangerous.
     *
     * 3. The utility gopher2redis.rb that we provide for Redis, and any
     *    other similar tool you may use as Gopher authoring system for
     *    Redis, can just add the "Lastline" when needed.
