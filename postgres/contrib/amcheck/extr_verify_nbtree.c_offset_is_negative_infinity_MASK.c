	 * infinity item is either first or second line item, or there is none
	 * within page.
	 *
	 * Negative infinity items are a special case among pivot tuples.  They
	 * always have zero attributes, while all other pivot tuples always have
	 * nkeyatts attributes.
	 *
	 * Right-most pages don't have a high key, but could be said to
	 * conceptually have a "positive infinity" high key.  Thus, there is a
	 * symmetry between down link items in parent pages, and high keys in
	 * children.  Together, they represent the part of the key space that
	 * belongs to each page in the index.  For example, all children of the
	 * root page will have negative infinity as a lower bound from root
	 * negative infinity downlink, and positive infinity as an upper bound
	 * (implicitly, from "imaginary" positive infinity high key in root).
