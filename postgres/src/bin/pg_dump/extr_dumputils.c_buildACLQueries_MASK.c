	 * To get the delta from what the permissions were at creation time
	 * (either initdb or CREATE EXTENSION) vs. what they are now, we have to
	 * look at two things:
	 *
	 * What privileges have been added, which we calculate by extracting all
	 * the current privileges (using the set of default privileges for the
	 * object type if current privileges are NULL) and then removing those
	 * which existed at creation time (again, using the set of default
	 * privileges for the object type if there were no creation time
	 * privileges).
	 *
	 * What privileges have been removed, which we calculate by extracting the
	 * privileges as they were at creation time (or the default privileges, as
	 * above), and then removing the current privileges (or the default
	 * privileges, if current privileges are NULL).
	 *
	 * As a good cross-check, both directions of these checks should result in
	 * the empty set if both the current ACL and the initial privs are NULL
	 * (meaning, in practice, that the default ACLs were there at init time
	 * and is what the current privileges are).
	 *
	 * We always perform this delta on all ACLs and expect that by the time
	 * these are run the initial privileges will be in place, even in a binary
	 * upgrade situation (see below).
	 *
	 * Finally, the order in which privileges are in the ACL string (the order
	 * they been GRANT'd in, which the backend maintains) must be preserved to
	 * ensure that GRANTs WITH GRANT OPTION and subsequent GRANTs based on
	 * those are dumped in the correct order.
