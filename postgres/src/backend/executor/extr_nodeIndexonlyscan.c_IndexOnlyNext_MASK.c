		 *
		 * We need to detect clearing a VM bit due to an insert right away,

		 * is cleared before updating the index, and locking/unlocking of the
		 * index page acts as a full memory barrier, we are sure to see the

		 * Deletes do not update the index page (only VACUUM will clear out
		 * the TID), so the clearing of the VM bit by a delete is not
		 * serialized with this test below, and we may see a value that is
		 * significantly stale. However, we don't care about the delete right
		 * away, because the tuple is still visible until the deleting
		 * transaction commits or the statement ends (if it's our
		 * transaction). In either case, the lock on the VM buffer will have
		 * been released (acting as a write barrier) after clearing the bit.
		 * And for us to have a snapshot that includes the deleting
		 * transaction (making the tuple invisible), we must have acquired
		 * ProcArrayLock after that time, acting as a read barrier.
