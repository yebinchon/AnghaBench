	/*----------
	 * The user-visible GUC parameter is the number of drives (spindles),
	 * which we need to translate to a number-of-pages-to-prefetch target.
	 * The target value is stashed in *extra and then assigned to the actual
	 * variable by assign_effective_io_concurrency.
	 *
	 * The expected number of prefetch pages needed to keep N drives busy is:
	 *
	 * drives |   I/O requests
	 * -------+----------------
	 *		1 |   1
	 *		2 |   2/1 + 2/2 = 3
	 *		3 |   3/1 + 3/2 + 3/3 = 5 1/2
	 *		4 |   4/1 + 4/2 + 4/3 + 4/4 = 8 1/3
	 *		n |   n * H(n)
	 *
	 * This is called the "coupon collector problem" and H(n) is called the
	 * harmonic series.  This could be approximated by n * ln(n), but for
	 * reasonable numbers of drives we might as well just compute the series.
	 *
	 * Alternatively we could set the target to the number of pages necessary
	 * so that the expected number of active spindles is some arbitrary
	 * percentage of the total.  This sounds the same but is actually slightly
	 * different.  The result ends up being ln(1-P)/ln((n-1)/n) where P is
	 * that desired fraction.
	 *
	 * Experimental results show that both of these formulas aren't aggressive
	 * enough, but we don't really have any better proposals.
	 *
	 * Note that if io_concurrency = 0 (disabled), we must set target = 0.
