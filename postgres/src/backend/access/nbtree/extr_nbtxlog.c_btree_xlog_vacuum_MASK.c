	 * This section of code is thought to be no longer needed, after analysis
	 * of the calling paths. It is retained to allow the code to be reinstated
	 * if a flaw is revealed in that thinking.
	 *
	 * If we are running non-MVCC scans using this index we need to do some
	 * additional work to ensure correctness, which is known as a "pin scan"
	 * described in more detail in next paragraphs. We used to do the extra
	 * work in all cases, whereas we now avoid that work in most cases. If
	 * lastBlockVacuumed is set to InvalidBlockNumber then we skip the
	 * additional work required for the pin scan.
	 *
	 * Avoiding this extra work is important since it requires us to touch
	 * every page in the index, so is an O(N) operation. Worse, it is an
	 * operation performed in the foreground during redo, so it delays
	 * replication directly.
	 *
	 * If queries might be active then we need to ensure every leaf page is
	 * unpinned between the lastBlockVacuumed and the current block, if there
	 * are any.  This prevents replay of the VACUUM from reaching the stage of
	 * removing heap tuples while there could still be indexscans "in flight"
	 * to those particular tuples for those scans which could be confused by
	 * finding new tuples at the old TID locations (see nbtree/README).
	 *
	 * It might be worth checking if there are actually any backends running;
	 * if not, we could just skip this.
	 *
	 * Since VACUUM can visit leaf pages out-of-order, it might issue records
	 * with lastBlockVacuumed >= block; that's not an error, it just means
	 * nothing to do now.
	 *
	 * Note: since we touch all pages in the range, we will lock non-leaf
	 * pages, and also any empty (all-zero) pages that may be in the index. It
	 * doesn't seem worth the complexity to avoid that.  But it's important
	 * that HotStandbyActiveInReplay() will not return true if the database
	 * isn't yet consistent; so we need not fear reading still-corrupt blocks
	 * here during crash recovery.

			 * throw an error here.  (We could skip acquiring the cleanup lock
			 * if PageIsNew, but it's probably not worth the cycles to test.)
			 *
