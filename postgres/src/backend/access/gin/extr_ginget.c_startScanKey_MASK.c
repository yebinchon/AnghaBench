	 * decide if an item matches. When scanning, we can skip over items from
	 * additional entries that have no corresponding matches in any of the
	 * required entries. That speeds up queries like "frequent & rare"
	 * considerably, if the frequent term can be put in the additional set.
	 *
	 * There can be many legal ways to divide them entries into these two
	 * sets. A conservative division is to just put everything in the required
	 * set, but the more you can put in the additional set, the more you can
	 * skip during the scan. To maximize skipping, we try to put as many
	 * frequent items as possible into additional, and less frequent ones into
	 * required. To do that, sort the entries by frequency
	 * (predictNumberResult), and put entries into the required set in that
	 * order, until the consistent function says that none of the remaining
	 * entries can form a match, without any items from the required set. The
	 * rest go to the additional set.
