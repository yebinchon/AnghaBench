	 * moving average of the amount of WAL generated in previous checkpoint
	 * cycles. However, if the load is bursty, with quiet periods and busy
	 * periods, we want to cater for the peak load. So instead of a plain
	 * moving average, let the average decline slowly if the previous cycle
	 * used less WAL than estimated, but bump it up immediately if it used
	 * more.
	 *
	 * When checkpoints are triggered by max_wal_size, this should converge to
	 * CheckpointSegments * wal_segment_size,
	 *
	 * Note: This doesn't pay any attention to what caused the checkpoint.
	 * Checkpoints triggered manually with CHECKPOINT command, or by e.g.
	 * starting a base backup, are counted the same as those created
	 * automatically. The slow-decline will largely mask them out, if they are
	 * not frequent. If they are frequent, it seems reasonable to count them
	 * in as any others; if you issue a manual checkpoint every 5 minutes and
	 * never let a timed checkpoint happen, it makes sense to base the
	 * preallocation on that 5 minute interval rather than whatever
	 * checkpoint_timeout is set to.
