	 * include the new page, or gistNewBuffer already has write lock on the
	 * buffer and it will be fully initialized before we can examine it.  (See
	 * also vacuumlazy.c, which has the same issue.)  Also, we need not worry
	 * if a page is added immediately after we look; the page splitting code
	 * already has write-lock on the left page before it adds a right page, so
	 * we must already have processed any tuples due to be moved into such a
