	 * The strategy here is to identify every potentially useful set of outer
	 * rels that can provide indexable join clauses.  For each such set,
	 * select all the join clauses available from those outer rels, add on all
	 * the indexable restriction clauses, and generate plain and/or bitmap
	 * index paths for that set of clauses.  This is based on the assumption
	 * that it's always better to apply a clause as an indexqual than as a
	 * filter (qpqual); which is where an available clause would end up being
	 * applied if we omit it from the indexquals.
	 *
	 * This looks expensive, but in most practical cases there won't be very
	 * many distinct sets of outer rels to consider.  As a safety valve when
	 * that's not true, we use a heuristic: limit the number of outer rel sets
	 * considered to a multiple of the number of clauses considered.  (We'll
	 * always consider using each individual join clause, though.)
	 *
	 * For simplicity in selecting relevant clauses, we represent each set of
	 * outer rels as a maximum set of clause_relids --- that is, the indexed
	 * relation itself is also included in the relids set.  considered_relids
	 * lists all relids sets we've already tried.
