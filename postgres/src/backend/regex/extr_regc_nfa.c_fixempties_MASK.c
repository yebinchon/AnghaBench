	 * For each remaining NFA state, find all other states from which it is
	 * reachable by a chain of one or more EMPTY arcs.  Then generate new arcs
	 * that eliminate the need for each such chain.
	 *
	 * We could replace a chain of EMPTY arcs that leads from a "from" state
	 * to a "to" state either by pushing non-EMPTY arcs forward (linking
	 * directly from "from"'s predecessors to "to") or by pulling them back
	 * (linking directly from "from" to "to"'s successors).  We choose to
	 * always do the former; this choice is somewhat arbitrary, but the
	 * approach below requires that we uniformly do one or the other.
	 *
	 * Suppose we have a chain of N successive EMPTY arcs (where N can easily
	 * approach the size of the NFA).  All of the intermediate states must
	 * have additional inarcs and outarcs, else they'd have been removed by
	 * the steps above.  Assuming their inarcs are mostly not empties, we will
	 * add O(N^2) arcs to the NFA, since a non-EMPTY inarc leading to any one
	 * state in the chain must be duplicated to lead to all its successor
	 * states as well.  So there is no hope of doing less than O(N^2) work;
	 * however, we should endeavor to keep the big-O cost from being even
	 * worse than that, which it can easily become without care.  In
	 * particular, suppose we were to copy all S1's inarcs forward to S2, and
	 * then also to S3, and then later we consider pushing S2's inarcs forward
	 * to S3.  If we include the arcs already copied from S1 in that, we'd be
	 * doing O(N^3) work.  (The duplicate-arc elimination built into newarc()
	 * and its cohorts would get rid of the extra arcs, but not without cost.)
	 *
	 * We can avoid this cost by treating only arcs that existed at the start
	 * of this phase as candidates to be pushed forward.  To identify those,
	 * we remember the first inarc each state had to start with.  We rely on
	 * the fact that newarc() and friends put new arcs on the front of their
	 * to-states' inchains, and that this phase never deletes arcs, so that
	 * the original arcs must be the last arcs in their to-states' inchains.
	 *
	 * So the process here is that, for each state in the NFA, we gather up
	 * all non-EMPTY inarcs of states that can reach the target state via
	 * EMPTY arcs.  We then sort, de-duplicate, and merge these arcs into the
	 * target state's inchain.  (We can safely use sort-merge for this as long
	 * as we update each state's original-arcs pointer after we add arcs to
	 * it; the sort step of mergeins probably changed the order of the old
	 * arcs.)
	 *
	 * Another refinement worth making is that, because we only add non-EMPTY
	 * arcs during this phase, and all added arcs have the same from-state as
	 * the non-EMPTY arc they were cloned from, we know ahead of time that any
	 * states having only EMPTY outarcs will be useless for lack of outarcs
	 * after we drop the EMPTY arcs.  (They cannot gain non-EMPTY outarcs if
	 * they had none to start with.)  So we need not bother to update the
	 * inchains of such states at all.
