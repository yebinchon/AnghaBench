	 * committed. Since we will only ever look at tuples from transactions
	 * that have modified the catalog it's more efficient to store those few
	 * that exist between xmin and xmax (frequently there are none).
	 *

	 * also use the 'subxip' array to store their toplevel xid and all the
	 * subtransaction xids so we can recognize when we need to treat rows as
	 * visible that are not in xip but still need to be visible. Subxip only
	 * gets filled when the transaction is copied into the context of a
	 * catalog modifying transaction since we otherwise share a snapshot
	 * between transactions. As long as a txn hasn't modified the catalog it
	 * doesn't need to treat any uncommitted rows as visible, so there is no
	 * need for those xids.
