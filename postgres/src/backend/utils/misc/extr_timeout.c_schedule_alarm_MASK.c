		 * interrupt could occur before we can set alarm_enabled, so that the
		 * signal handler would fail to do anything.
		 *
		 * Because we didn't bother to reset the timer in disable_alarm(),
		 * it's possible that a previously-set interrupt will fire between
		 * enable_alarm() and setitimer().  This is safe, however.  There are
		 * two possible outcomes:
		 *
		 * 1. The signal handler finds nothing to do (because the nearest
		 * timeout event is still in the future).  It will re-set the timer
		 * and return.  Then we'll overwrite the timer value with a new one.
		 * This will mean that the timer fires a little later than we
		 * intended, but only by the amount of time it takes for the signal
		 * handler to do nothing useful, which shouldn't be much.
		 *
		 * 2. The signal handler executes and removes one or more timeout
		 * events.  When it returns, either the queue is now empty or the
		 * frontmost event is later than the one we looked at above.  So we'll
		 * overwrite the timer value with one that is too soon (plus or minus
		 * the signal handler's execution time), causing a useless interrupt
		 * to occur.  But the handler will then re-set the timer and
		 * everything will still work as expected.
		 *
		 * Since these cases are of very low probability (the window here
		 * being quite narrow), it's not worth adding cycles to the mainline
		 * code to prevent occasional wasted interrupts.
