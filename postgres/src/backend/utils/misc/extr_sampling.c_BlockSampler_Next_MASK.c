	 * It is not obvious that this code matches Knuth's Algorithm S.
	 * Knuth says to skip the current block with probability 1 - k/K.
	 * If we are to skip, we should advance t (hence decrease K), and
	 * repeat the same probabilistic test for the next block.  The naive
	 * implementation thus requires a sampler_random_fract() call for each
	 * block number.  But we can reduce this to one sampler_random_fract()
	 * call per selected block, by noting that each time the while-test
	 * succeeds, we can reinterpret V as a uniform random number in the range
	 * 0 to p. Therefore, instead of choosing a new V, we just adjust p to be
	 * the appropriate fraction of its former value, and our next loop
	 * makes the appropriate probabilistic test.
	 *
	 * We have initially K > k > 0.  If the loop reduces K to equal k,
	 * the next while-test must fail since p will become exactly zero
	 * (we assume there will not be roundoff error in the division).
	 * (Note: Knuth suggests a "<=" loop condition, but we use "<" just
	 * to be doubly sure about roundoff error.)  Therefore K cannot become
	 * less than k, which means that we cannot fail to select enough blocks.
