	 * A hash index has no descent costs as such, since the index AM can go
	 * directly to the target bucket after computing the hash value.  There
	 * are a couple of other hash-specific costs that we could conceivably add
	 * here, though:
	 *
	 * Ideally we'd charge spc_random_page_cost for each page in the target
	 * bucket, not just the numIndexPages pages that genericcostestimate
	 * thought we'd visit.  However in most cases we don't know which bucket
	 * that will be.  There's no point in considering the average bucket size
	 * because the hash AM makes sure that's always one page.
	 *
	 * Likewise, we could consider charging some CPU for each index tuple in
	 * the bucket, if we knew how many there were.  But the per-tuple cost is
	 * just a hash value comparison, not a general datatype-dependent
	 * comparison, so any such charge ought to be quite a bit less than
	 * cpu_operator_cost; which makes it probably not worth worrying about.
	 *
	 * A bigger issue is that chance hash-value collisions will result in
	 * wasted probes into the heap.  We don't currently attempt to model this
	 * cost on the grounds that it's rare, but maybe it's not rare enough.
	 * (Any fix for this ought to consider the generic lossy-operator problem,
	 * though; it's not entirely hash-specific.)
