	 * The average of a function between A and B can be calculated by the

	 *
	 *			B
	 *	  1		/
	 * -------	| P(x)dx
	 *	B - A	/
	 *			A
	 *
	 * The geometrical interpretation of the integral is the area under the
	 * graph of P(x). P(x) is defined by the length histogram. We calculate
	 * the area in a piecewise fashion, iterating through the length histogram
	 * bins. Each bin is a trapezoid:
	 *
	 *		 P(x2)
	 *		  /|
	 *		 / |
	 * P(x1)/  |
	 *	   |   |
	 *	   |   |
	 *	---+---+--
	 *	   x1  x2
	 *
	 * where x1 and x2 are the boundaries of the current histogram, and P(x1)
	 * and P(x1) are the cumulative fraction of tuples at the boundaries.
	 *
	 * The area of each trapezoid is 1/2 * (P(x2) + P(x1)) * (x2 - x1)
	 *
	 * The first bin contains the lower bound passed by the caller, so we
	 * use linear interpolation between the previous and next histogram bin
	 * boundary to calculate P(x1). Likewise for the last bin: we use linear
	 * interpolation to calculate P(x2). For the bins in between, x1 and x2
	 * lie on histogram bin boundaries, so P(x1) and P(x2) are simply:
	 * P(x1) =	  (bin index) / (number of bins)
	 * P(x2) = (bin index + 1 / (number of bins)
