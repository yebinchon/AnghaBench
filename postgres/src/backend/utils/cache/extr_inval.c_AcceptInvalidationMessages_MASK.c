	 * Test code to force cache flushes anytime a flush could happen.

	 * If used with CLOBBER_FREED_MEMORY, CLOBBER_CACHE_ALWAYS provides a
	 * fairly thorough test that the system contains no cache-flush hazards.
	 * However, it also makes the system unbelievably slow --- the regression
	 * tests take about 100 times longer than normal.
	 *
	 * If you're a glutton for punishment, try CLOBBER_CACHE_RECURSIVELY. This
	 * slows things by at least a factor of 10000, so I wouldn't suggest
	 * trying to run the entire regression tests that way.  It's useful to try
	 * a few simple tests, to make sure that cache reload isn't subject to
	 * internal cache-flush hazards, but after you've done a few thousand
	 * recursive reloads it's unlikely you'll learn more.
