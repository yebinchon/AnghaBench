			 * send data to us.  (This can happen when we are sending a large

			 * prepared to accept and buffer incoming data before we try
			 * again.  Furthermore, it is possible that such incoming data
			 * might not arrive until after we've gone to sleep.  Therefore,
			 * we wait for either read ready or write ready.
			 *
			 * In non-blocking mode, we don't wait here directly, but return 1
			 * to indicate that data is still pending.  The caller should wait
			 * for both read and write ready conditions, and call
			 * PQconsumeInput() on read ready, but just in case it doesn't, we
			 * call pqReadData() ourselves before returning.  That's not
			 * enough if the data has not arrived yet, but it's the best we
			 * can do, and works pretty well in practice.  (The documentation
			 * used to say that you only need to wait for write-ready, so
			 * there are still plenty of applications like that out there.)
