         * root cgroup this might actually not be the case, because cgroup namespacing might be in effect
         * (CLONE_NEWCGROUP). Since there's no nice way to distinguish a real cgroup root from a fake namespaced one we
         * do an explicit container check here, under the assumption that CLONE_NEWCGROUP is generally used when
         * container managers are used too.
         *
         * Note that checking for a container environment is kinda ugly, since in theory people could use cgtop from
         * inside a container where cgroup namespacing is turned off to watch the host system. However, that's mostly a
         * theoretic usecase, and if people actually try all they'll lose is accounting for the top-level cgroup. Which
         * isn't too bad. */
