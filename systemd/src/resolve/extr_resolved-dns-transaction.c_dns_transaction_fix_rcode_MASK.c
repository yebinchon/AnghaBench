         * CNAME/DNAME chain element coming after the last chain element contained in the message, and not the first
         * one included. However, it also indicates that not all DNS servers implement this correctly. Moreover, when
         * using DNSSEC we usually only can prove the first element of a CNAME/DNAME chain anyway, hence let's settle
         * on always processing the RCODE as referring to the immediate look-up we do, i.e. the first element of a
         * CNAME/DNAME chain. This way, we uniformly handle CNAME/DNAME chains, regardless if the DNS server
         * incorrectly implements RCODE, whether DNSSEC is in use, or whether the DNS server only supplied us with an
         * incomplete CNAME/DNAME chain.
         *
         * Or in other words: if we get at least one positive reply in a message we patch NXDOMAIN to become SUCCESS,
         * and then rely on the CNAME chasing logic to figure out that there's actually a CNAME error with a new
         * lookup. */
