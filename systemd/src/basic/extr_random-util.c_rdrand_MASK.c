        /* So, you are a "security researcher", and you wonder why we bother with using raw RDRAND here,
         * instead of sticking to /dev/urandom or getrandom()?
         *
         * Here's why: early boot. On Linux, during early boot the random pool that backs /dev/urandom and
         * getrandom() is generally not initialized yet. It is very common that initialization of the random
         * pool takes a longer time (up to many minutes), in particular on embedded devices that have no
         * explicit hardware random generator, as well as in virtualized environments such as major cloud
         * installations that do not provide virtio-rng or a similar mechanism.
         *
         * In such an environment using getrandom() synchronously means we'd block the entire system boot-up
         * until the pool is initialized, i.e. *very* long. Using getrandom() asynchronously (GRND_NONBLOCK)
         * would mean acquiring randomness during early boot would simply fail. Using /dev/urandom would mean
         * generating many kmsg log messages about our use of it before the random pool is properly
         * initialized. Neither of these outcomes is desirable.
         *
         * Thus, for very specific purposes we use RDRAND instead of either of these three options. RDRAND
         * provides us quickly and relatively reliably with random values, without having to delay boot,
         * without triggering warning messages in kmsg.
         *
         * Note that we use RDRAND only under very specific circumstances, when the requirements on the
         * quality of the returned entropy permit it. Specifically, here are some cases where we *do* use
         * RDRAND:
         *
         *         â€¢ UUID generation: UUIDs are supposed to be universally unique but are not cryptographic
         *           key material. The quality and trust level of RDRAND should hence be OK: UUIDs should be
         *           generated in a way that is reliably unique, but they do not require ultimate trust into
         *           the entropy generator. systemd generates a number of UUIDs during early boot, including
         *           'invocation IDs' for every unit spawned that identify the specific invocation of the
         *           service globally, and a number of others. Other alternatives for generating these UUIDs
         *           have been considered, but don't really work: for example, hashing uuids from a local
         *           system identifier combined with a counter falls flat because during early boot disk
         *           storage is not yet available (think: initrd) and thus a system-specific ID cannot be
         *           stored or retrieved yet.
         *
         *         â€¢ Hash table seed generation: systemd uses many hash tables internally. Hash tables are
         *           generally assumed to have O(1) access complexity, but can deteriorate to prohibitive
         *           O(n) access complexity if an attacker manages to trigger a large number of hash
         *           collisions. Thus, systemd (as any software employing hash tables should) uses seeded
         *           hash functions for its hash tables, with a seed generated randomly. The hash tables
         *           systemd employs watch the fill level closely and reseed if necessary. This allows use of
         *           a low quality RNG initially, as long as it improves should a hash table be under attack:
         *           the attacker after all needs to to trigger many collisions to exploit it for the purpose
         *           of DoS, but if doing so improves the seed the attack surface is reduced as the attack
         *           takes place.
         *
         * Some cases where we do NOT use RDRAND are:
         *
         *         â€¢ Generation of cryptographic key material ðŸ”‘
         *
         *         â€¢ Generation of cryptographic salt values ðŸ§‚
         *
         * This function returns:
         *
         *         -EOPNOTSUPP â†’ RDRAND is not available on this system ðŸ˜”
         *         -EAGAIN     â†’ The operation failed this time, but is likely to work if you try again a few
         *                       times â™»
         *         -EUCLEAN    â†’ We got some random value, but it looked strange, so we refused using it.
         *                       This failure might or might not be temporary. ðŸ˜•
