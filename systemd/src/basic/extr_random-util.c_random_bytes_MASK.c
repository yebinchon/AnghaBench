         * What this function will do:
         *
         *         • This function will preferably use the CPU's RDRAND operation, if it is available, in
         *           order to return "mid-quality" random values cheaply.
         *
         *         • Use getrandom() with GRND_NONBLOCK, to return high-quality random values if they are
         *           cheaply available.
         *
         *         • This function will return pseudo-random data, generated via libc rand() if nothing
         *           better is available.
         *
         *         • This function will work fine in early boot
         *
         *         • This function will always succeed
         *
         * What this function won't do:
         *
         *         • This function will never fail: it will give you randomness no matter what. It might not
         *           be high quality, but it will return some, possibly generated via libc's rand() call.
         *
         *         • This function will never block: if the only way to get good randomness is a blocking,
         *           synchronous getrandom() we'll instead provide you with pseudo-random data.
         *
         * This function is hence great for things like seeding hash tables, generating random numeric UNIX
         * user IDs (that are checked for collisions before use) and such.
         *
         * This function is hence not useful for generating UUIDs or cryptographic key material.
