     * to dramatically reduce the TX power on a particular chain.
     *
     * Based on the value of (redefined) diversity_control, the
     * reset code will decrease power on chain 0 or chain 1/2.
     *
     * Based on the value of bit 0 of antenna_switch_swap,
     * the mapping between OID call and chain is defined as:
     *  0:  map A -> 0, B -> 1;
     *  1:  map A -> 1, B -> 0;
     *
     * NOTE:
     *   The devices that use this OID should use a tx_chain_mask and
     *   tx_chain_select_legacy setting of 5 or 3 if ANTENNA_FIXED_B is
     *   used in order to ensure an active transmit antenna.  This
     *   API will allow the host to turn off the only transmitting
     *   antenna to ensure the antenna closest to the user's body is
     *   powered-down.
