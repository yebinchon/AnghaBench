	 * These two bits need a bit better explanation.
	 *
	 * The default configuration in the hardware is to map both
	 * ports to the internal switch.
	 *
	 * Here, GE0 == arge0, GE1 == arge1.
	 *
	 * The internal switch has:
	 * + 5 MAC ports, MAC0->MAC4.
	 * + 5 PHY ports, PHY0->PHY4,
	 * + MAC0 connects to GE1;
	 * + GE0 connects to PHY4;
	 * + The other mappings are MAC1->PHY0, MAC2->PHY1 .. MAC4->PHY3.
	 *
	 * The GE1 port is linked in via 1000MBit/full, supplying what is
	 * normally the 'WAN' switch ports.
	 *
	 * The switch is connected the MDIO bus on GE1.  It looks like
	 * a normal AR7240 on-board switch.
	 *
	 * The GE0 port is connected via MII to PHY4, and can operate in
	 * 10/100mbit, full/half duplex.  Ie, you can speak to PHY4 on
	 * the MDIO bus and everything will simply 'work'.
	 *
	 * So far so good.  This looks just like an AR7240 SoC.
	 *
	 * However, some configurations will just expose one or two
	 * physical ports.  In this case, some configuration bits can
	 * be set to tweak this.
	 *
	 * + CFG_SW_PHY_ADDR_SWAP swaps PHY port 0 with PHY port 4.
	 *   Ie, GE0's PHY shows up as PHY 0.  So if there's only
	 *   one physical port, there's no need to involve the
	 *   switch framework - it can just show up as a default,
	 *   normal single PHY.
	 *
	 * + CFG_SW_PHY_SWAP swaps the internal switch connection
	 *   between PHY0 and PHY4.  Ie, PHY4 connects to MAc1,
	 *   PHY0 connects to GE0.
