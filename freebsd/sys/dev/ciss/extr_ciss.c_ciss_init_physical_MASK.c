     * Figure out the bus mapping.
     * Logical buses include both the local logical bus for local arrays and
     * proxy buses for remote arrays.  Physical buses are numbered by the
     * controller and represent physical buses that hold physical devices.
     * We shift these bus numbers so that everything fits into a single flat
     * numbering space for CAM.  Logical buses occupy the first 32 CAM bus
     * numbers, and the physical bus numbers are shifted to be above that.
     * This results in the various driver arrays being indexed as follows:
     *
     * ciss_controllers[] - indexed by logical bus
     * ciss_cam_sim[]     - indexed by both logical and physical, with physical
     *                      being shifted by 32.
     * ciss_logical[][]   - indexed by logical bus
     * ciss_physical[][]  - indexed by physical bus
     *
     * XXX This is getting more and more hackish.  CISS really doesn't play
     *     well with a standard SCSI model; devices are addressed via magic
     *     cookies, not via b/t/l addresses.  Since there is no way to store
     *     the cookie in the CAM device object, we have to keep these lookup
     *     tables handy so that the devices can be found quickly at the cost
     *     of wasting memory and having a convoluted lookup scheme.  This
     *     driver should probably be converted to block interface.

     * If the L2 and L3 SCSI addresses are 0, this signifies a proxy
     * controller. A proxy controller is another physical controller
     * behind the primary PCI controller. We need to know about this
     * so that BMIC commands can be properly targeted.  There can be
     * proxy controllers attached to a single PCI controller, so
     * find the highest numbered one so the array can be properly
     * sized.
