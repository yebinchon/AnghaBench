	 * Issue #2: INT# not qualified with IRQ Routing Bit.  An
	 * unexpected PCI INT# may be generated during PC Card
	 * initialization even with the IRQ Routing Bit Set with some
	 * PC Cards.
	 *
	 * This is a two part issue.  The first part is that some of
	 * our older controllers have an issue in which the slot's PCI
	 * INT# is NOT qualified by the IRQ routing bit (PCI reg. 3Eh
	 * bit 7).  Regardless of the IRQ routing bit, if NO ISA IRQ
	 * is selected (ExCA register 03h bits 3:0, of the slot, are
	 * cleared) we will generate INT# if IREQ# is asserted.  The
	 * second part is because some PC Cards prematurally assert
	 * IREQ# before the ExCA registers are fully programmed.  This
	 * in turn asserts INT# because ExCA register 03h bits 3:0
	 * (ISA IRQ Select) are not yet programmed.
	 *
	 * The fix for this issue, which will work for any controller
	 * (old or new), is to set ExCA register 03h bits 3:0 = 0001b
	 * (select IRQ1), of the slot, before turning on slot power.
	 * Selecting IRQ1 will result in INT# NOT being asserted
	 * (because IRQ1 is selected), and IRQ1 won't be asserted
	 * because our controllers don't generate IRQ1.
	 *
	 * Other, non O2Micro controllers will generate irq 1 in some
	 * situations, so we can't do this hack for everybody.  Reports of
	 * keyboard controller's interrupts being suppressed occurred when
	 * we did this.
