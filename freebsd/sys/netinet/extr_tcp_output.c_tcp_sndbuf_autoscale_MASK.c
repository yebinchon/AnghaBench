	 * Automatic sizing of send socket buffer.  Often the send buffer
	 * size is not optimally adjusted to the actual network conditions
	 * at hand (delay bandwidth product).  Setting the buffer size too
	 * small limits throughput on links with high bandwidth and high
	 * delay (eg. trans-continental/oceanic links).  Setting the
	 * buffer size too big consumes too much real kernel memory,
	 * especially with many connections on busy servers.
	 *
	 * The criteria to step up the send buffer one notch are:
	 *  1. receive window of remote host is larger than send buffer
	 *     (with a fudge factor of 5/4th);
	 *  2. send buffer is filled to 7/8th with data (so we actually
	 *     have data to make use of it);
	 *  3. send buffer fill has not hit maximal automatic size;
	 *  4. our send window (slow start and cogestion controlled) is
	 *     larger than sent but unacknowledged data in send buffer.
	 *
	 * The remote host receive window scaling factor may limit the
	 * growing of the send buffer before it reaches its allowed
	 * maximum.
	 *
	 * It scales directly with slow start or congestion window
	 * and does at most one step per received ACK.  This fast
	 * scaling has the drawback of growing the send buffer beyond
	 * what is strictly necessary to make full use of a given
	 * delay*bandwidth product.  However testing has shown this not
	 * to be much of an problem.  At worst we are trading wasting
	 * of available bandwidth (the non-use of it) for wasting some
	 * socket buffer memory.
	 *
	 * TODO: Shrink send buffer during idle periods together
	 * with congestion window.  Requires another timer.  Has to
	 * wait for upcoming tcp timer rewrite.
	 *
	 * XXXGL: should there be used sbused() or sbavail()?
