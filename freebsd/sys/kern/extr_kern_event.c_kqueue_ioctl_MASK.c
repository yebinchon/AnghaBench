	 * Enabling sigio causes two major problems:
	 * 1) infinite recursion:
	 * Synopsys: kevent is being used to track signals and have FIOASYNC
	 * set.  On receipt of a signal this will cause a kqueue to recurse
	 * into itself over and over.  Sending the sigio causes the kqueue
	 * to become ready, which in turn posts sigio again, forever.
	 * Solution: this can be solved by setting a flag in the kqueue that
	 * we have a SIGIO in progress.
	 * 2) locking problems:
	 * Synopsys: Kqueue is a leaf subsystem, but adding signalling puts
	 * us above the proc and pgrp locks.
	 * Solution: Post a signal using an async mechanism, being sure to
	 * record a generation count in the delivery so that we do not deliver
	 * a signal to the wrong process.
	 *
	 * Note, these two mechanisms are somewhat mutually exclusive!
