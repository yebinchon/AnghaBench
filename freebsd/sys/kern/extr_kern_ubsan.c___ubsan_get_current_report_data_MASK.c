	 * The __ubsan_on_report() feature is non trivial to implement in a
	 * shared code between the kernel and userland. It's also opening
	 * new sets of potential problems as we are not expected to slow down
	 * execution of certain kernel subsystems (synchronization issues,
	 * interrupt handling etc).
	 *
	 * A proper solution would need probably a lock-free bounded queue built
	 * with atomic operations with the property of miltiple consumers and
	 * multiple producers. Maintaining and validating such code is not
	 * worth the effort.
	 *
	 * A legitimate user - besides testing framework - is a debugger plugin
	 * intercepting reports from the UBSan instrumentation. For such
	 * scenarios it is better to run the Clang/GCC version.
