	 * increment the offsets, so that we can support a hierarchy, e.g.
	 * "vlan 300 && vlan 200" to capture VLAN 200 encapsulated within
	 * VLAN 100.
	 *
	 * XXX - this is a bit of a kludge.  If we were to split the
	 * compiler into a parser that parses an expression and
	 * generates an expression tree, and a code generator that
	 * takes an expression tree (which could come from our
	 * parser or from some other parser) and generates BPF code,
	 * we could perhaps make the offsets parameters of routines
	 * and, in the handler for an "AND" node, pass to subnodes
	 * other than the VLAN node the adjusted offsets.
	 *
	 * This would mean that "vlan" would, instead of changing the
	 * behavior of *all* tests after it, change only the behavior
	 * of tests ANDed with it.  That would change the documented
	 * semantics of "vlan", which might break some expressions.
	 * However, it would mean that "(vlan and ip) or ip" would check
	 * both for VLAN-encapsulated IP and IP-over-Ethernet, rather than
	 * checking only for VLAN-encapsulated IP, so that could still
	 * be considered worth doing; it wouldn't break expressions
	 * that are of the form "vlan and ..." or "vlan N and ...",
	 * which I suspect are the most common expressions involving
	 * "vlan".  "vlan or ..." doesn't necessarily do what the user
	 * would really want, now, as all the "or ..." tests would
	 * be done assuming a VLAN, even though the "or" could be viewed
	 * as meaning "or, if this isn't a VLAN packet...".
