	 *
	 * XXX - this is a bit of a kludge.  If we were to split the
	 * compiler into a parser that parses an expression and
	 * generates an expression tree, and a code generator that
	 * takes an expression tree (which could come from our
	 * parser or from some other parser) and generates BPF code,
	 * we could perhaps make the offsets parameters of routines
	 * and, in the handler for an "AND" node, pass to subnodes
	 * other than the PPPoE node the adjusted offsets.
	 *
	 * This would mean that "pppoes" would, instead of changing the
	 * behavior of *all* tests after it, change only the behavior
	 * of tests ANDed with it.  That would change the documented
	 * semantics of "pppoes", which might break some expressions.
	 * However, it would mean that "(pppoes and ip) or ip" would check
	 * both for VLAN-encapsulated IP and IP-over-Ethernet, rather than
	 * checking only for VLAN-encapsulated IP, so that could still
	 * be considered worth doing; it wouldn't break expressions
	 * that are of the form "pppoes and ..." which I suspect are the
	 * most common expressions involving "pppoes".  "pppoes or ..."
	 * doesn't necessarily do what the user would really want, now,
	 * as all the "or ..." tests would be done assuming PPPoE, even
	 * though the "or" could be viewed as meaning "or, if this isn't
	 * a PPPoE packet...".
	 *
	 * The "network-layer" protocol is PPPoE, which has a 6-byte
	 * PPPoE header, followed by a PPP packet.
	 *
	 * There is no HDLC encapsulation for the PPP packet (it's
	 * encapsulated in PPPoES instead), so the link-layer type
	 * starts at the first byte of the PPP packet.  For PPPoE,
	 * that offset is relative to the beginning of the total
	 * link-layer payload, including any 802.2 LLC header, so
	 * it's 6 bytes past cstate->off_nl.
