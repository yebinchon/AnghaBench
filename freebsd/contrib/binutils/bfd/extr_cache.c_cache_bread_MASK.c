     internally and tries to link against them.  BFD seems to be smart

     doesn't exist but attempts to read them anyway.  On Solaris,
     attempting to read zero bytes from a NULL file results in a core
     dump, but on other platforms it just returns zero bytes read.
     This makes it to something reasonable. - DJ */
