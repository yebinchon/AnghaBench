     is diff02, thread number 1 is diff12.  USING is the base of the
     list of blocks to be used to construct each block of the three
     way diff; if no blocks from a particular thread are to be used,
     that element of USING is 0.  LAST_USING contains the last
     elements on each of the using lists.

     HIGH_WATER_MARK is the highest line number in the common file
     described in any of the diffs in either of the USING lists.
     HIGH_WATER_THREAD names the thread.  Similarly BASE_WATER_MARK
     and BASE_WATER_THREAD describe the lowest line number in the
     common file described in any of the diffs in either of the USING
     lists.  HIGH_WATER_DIFF is the diff from which the
     HIGH_WATER_MARK was taken.

     HIGH_WATER_DIFF should always be equal to
     LAST_USING[HIGH_WATER_THREAD].  OTHER_DIFF is the next diff to
     check for higher water, and should always be equal to
     CURRENT[HIGH_WATER_THREAD ^ 1].  OTHER_THREAD is the thread in
     which the OTHER_DIFF is, and hence should always be equal to
     HIGH_WATER_THREAD ^ 1.

     LAST_DIFF is the last diff block produced by this routine, for
     line correspondence purposes between that diff and the one
     currently being worked on.  It is ZERO_DIFF before any blocks
     have been created.  */
