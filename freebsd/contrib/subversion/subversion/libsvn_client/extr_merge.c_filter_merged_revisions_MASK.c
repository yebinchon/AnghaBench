             We don't consider inheritance when determining intersecting
             ranges.  If we *did* consider inheritance, then our calculation
             would be wrong.  For example, if the CHILD->REMAINING_RANGES is
             5:3 and TARGET_RANGELIST is r5* (non-inheritable) then the
             intersection would be r4.  And that would be wrong as we clearly
             want to reverse merge both r4 and r5 in this case.  Ignoring the
             ranges' inheritance results in an intersection of r4-5.

             You might be wondering about CHILD's children, doesn't the above
             imply that we will reverse merge r4-5 from them?  Nope, this is
             safe to do because any path whose parent has non-inheritable
             ranges is always considered a subtree with differing mergeinfo
             even if that path has no explicit mergeinfo prior to the
             merge -- See condition 3 in the doc string for
             merge.c:get_mergeinfo_paths(). */
