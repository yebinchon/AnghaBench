     that max is 54, and apr_size_t is six bits long; its range is
     0..63.  If we're parsing the number "502", then value will be 50
     after parsing the first two digits.  50 * 10 = 500.  But 500
     doesn't fit in an apr_size_t, so it'll be truncated to 500 mod 64
     = 52, which is less than max, so we'd fail to recognize the
     overflow.  Furthermore, it *is* greater than 50, so you can't
     detect overflow by checking whether value actually increased
     after each multiplication --- sometimes it does increase, but
     it's still wrong.

     So we do the check for overflow before we multiply value and add
     in the new digit.  */
