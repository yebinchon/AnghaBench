	 * !!!
	 * In historic vi, 'u' toggled between "undo" and "redo", i.e. 'u'
	 * undid the last undo.  However, if there has been a change since
	 * the last undo/redo, we always do an undo.  To make this work when
	 * the user can undo multiple operations, we leave the old semantic
	 * unchanged, but make '.' after a 'u' do another undo/redo operation.
	 * This has two problems.
	 *
	 * The first is that 'u' didn't set '.' in historic vi.  So, if a
	 * user made a change, realized it was in the wrong place, does a
	 * 'u' to undo it, moves to the right place and then does '.', the
	 * change was reapplied.  To make this work, we only apply the '.'
	 * to the undo command if it's the command immediately following an
	 * undo command.  See vi/vi.c:getcmd() for the details.
	 *
	 * The second is that the traditional way to view the numbered cut
	 * buffers in vi was to enter the commands "1pu.u.u.u. which will
	 * no longer work because the '.' immediately follows the 'u' command.
	 * Since we provide a much better method of viewing buffers, and
	 * nobody can think of a better way of adding in multiple undo, this
	 * remains broken.
	 *
	 * !!!
	 * There is change to historic practice for the final cursor position
	 * in this implementation.  In historic vi, if an undo was isolated to
	 * a single line, the cursor moved to the start of the change, and
	 * then, subsequent 'u' commands would not move it again. (It has been
	 * pointed out that users used multiple undo commands to get the cursor
	 * to the start of the changed text.)  Nvi toggles between the cursor
	 * position before and after the change was made.  One final issue is
	 * that historic vi only did this if the user had not moved off of the
	 * line before entering the undo command; otherwise, vi would move the
	 * cursor to the most attractive position on the changed line.
	 *
	 * It would be difficult to match historic practice in this area. You
	 * not only have to know that the changes were isolated to one line,
	 * but whether it was the first or second undo command as well.  And,
	 * to completely match historic practice, we'd have to track users line
	 * changes, too.  This isn't worth the effort.
