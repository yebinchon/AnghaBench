	 * are logical motions in this implementation, we do the next nonblank
	 * so that it looks approximately the same to the user.  To make this
	 * happen, the VM_RCM_SETNNB flag is set in the vcmd.c command table.
	 *
	 * If it's a motion, it's more complicated.  The best possible solution
	 * is probably to display the first nonblank of the line the cursor
	 * will eventually rest on.  This is tricky, particularly given that if
	 * the associated command is a delete, we don't yet know what line that
	 * will be.  So, we clear the VM_RCM_SETNNB flag, and set the first
	 * nonblank flag (VM_RCM_SETFNB).  Note, if the lines are sufficiently
	 * long, this can cause the cursor to warp out of the screen.  It's too
	 * hard to fix.
	 *
	 * XXX
	 * The G command is always first nonblank, so it's okay to reset it.
