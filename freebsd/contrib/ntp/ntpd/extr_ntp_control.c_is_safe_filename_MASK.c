	 * name!
	 *
	 * The first character must be digit or a letter from the ASCII
	 * base plane or a '_' ([_A-Za-z0-9]), the following characters
	 * must be from [-._+A-Za-z0-9].
	 *
	 * We do not trust the character classification much here: Since
	 * the NTP protocol makes no provisions for UTF-8 or local code
	 * pages, we strictly require the 7bit ASCII code page.
	 *
	 * The following table is a packed bit field of 128 two-bit
	 * groups. The LSB in each group tells us if a character is
	 * acceptable at the first position, the MSB if the character is
	 * accepted at any other position.
	 *
	 * This does not ensure that the file name is syntactically
	 * correct (multiple dots will not work with VMS...) but it will
	 * exclude potential globbing bombs and directory traversal. It
	 * also rules out drive selection. (For systems that have this
	 * notion, like Windows or VMS.)
