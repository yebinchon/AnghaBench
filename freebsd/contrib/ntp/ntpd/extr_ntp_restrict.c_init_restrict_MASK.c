	 * The restriction lists begin with a default entry with address
	 * and mask 0, which will match any entry.  The lists are kept
	 * sorted by descending address followed by descending mask:
	 *
	 *   address	  mask
	 * 192.168.0.0	255.255.255.0	kod limited noquery nopeer
	 * 192.168.0.0	255.255.0.0	kod limited
	 * 0.0.0.0	0.0.0.0		kod limited noquery
	 *
	 * The first entry which matches an address is used.  With the
	 * example restrictions above, 192.168.0.0/24 matches the first
	 * entry, the rest of 192.168.0.0/16 matches the second, and
	 * everything else matches the third (default).
	 *
	 * Note this achieves the same result a little more efficiently
	 * than the documented behavior, which is to keep the lists
	 * sorted by ascending address followed by ascending mask, with
	 * the _last_ matching entry used.
	 *
	 * An additional wrinkle is we may have multiple entries with
	 * the same address and mask but differing match flags (mflags).
	 * At present there is only one, RESM_NTPONLY.  Entries with
	 * RESM_NTPONLY are sorted earlier so they take precedence over
	 * any otherwise similar entry without.  Again, this is the same
	 * behavior as but reversed implementation compared to the docs.
