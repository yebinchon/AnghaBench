	 aligned (in theory, for performance).  This, unfortunately,
	 was done with .align directives, which had the side effect of
	 forcing the section to be aligned by the linker.

	 This becomes a problem when you have some other producer that
	 creates frame sections that are not as strictly aligned.  That
	 produces a hole in the frame info that gets filled by the 
	 linker with zeros.

	 The GCC behaviour is arguably a bug, but it's effectively now
	 part of the ABI, so we're now stuck with it, at least at the
	 object file level.  A smart linker may decide, in the process
	 of compressing duplicate CIE information, that it can rewrite
	 the entire output section without this extra padding.  */
