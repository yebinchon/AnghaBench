	     This is a Boyer-Moore kind of situation.  We want to reset P to

	     "...".  This longest prefix could be the empty string, if C
	     is nowhere to be found in STRING.

	     If this longest prefix is not the empty string, it must contain
	     C, so let's search from the end of STRING for instances of C,
	     and see if the portion of STRING before that is a suffix of
	     what we read before C.  Actually, we can search backwards from
	     p, since we know no prefix can be longer than that.
