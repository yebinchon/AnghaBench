  /* Our implementation depends on seeing calls to kernel code, for the

     When a protected page is accessed by user code, HP-UX raises a SIGBUS.
     Fine.

     But when kernel code accesses the page, it doesn't give a SIGBUS.
     Rather, the system call that touched the page fails, with errno=EFAULT.
     Not good for us.

     We could accomodate this "feature" by asking to be notified of syscall
     entries & exits; upon getting an entry event, disabling page-protections;
     upon getting an exit event, reenabling page-protections and then checking
     if any watchpoints triggered.

     However, this turns out to be a real performance loser.  syscalls are
     usually a frequent occurrence.  Having to unprotect-reprotect all watched
     pages, and also to then read all watched memory locations and compare for
     triggers, can be quite expensive.

     Instead, we'll only ask to be notified of syscall exits.  When we get
     one, we'll check whether errno is set.  If not, or if it's not EFAULT,
     we can just continue the inferior.

     If errno is set upon syscall exit to EFAULT, we must perform some fairly
     hackish stuff to determine whether the failure really was due to a
     page-protect trap on a watched location.
