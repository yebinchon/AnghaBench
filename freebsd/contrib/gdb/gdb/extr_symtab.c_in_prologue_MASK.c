       is the end of the prologue.  If available, this is the most
       reliable method.

       us the starting and ending addresses of a function.
     - If we know the function's start address, we can call the
       architecture-defined SKIP_PROLOGUE function to analyze the
       instruction stream and guess where the prologue ends.
     - Our `func_start' argument; if non-zero, this is the caller's
       best guess as to the function's entry point.  At the time of
       this writing, handle_inferior_event doesn't get this right, so
