  /* NOTE: carlton/2002-12-05: There is a question as to whether or
     not it would be appropriate to search the current global block
     here as well.  (That's what this code used to do before the
     is_a_field_of_this check was moved up.)  On the one hand, it's
     redundant with the lookup_symbol_aux_symtabs search that happens
     next.  On the other hand, if decode_line_1 is passed an argument
     like filename:var, then the user presumably wants 'var' to be
     searched for in filename.  On the third hand, there shouldn't be
     multiple global variables all of which are named 'var', and it's
     not like decode_line_1 has ever restricted its search to only
     global variables in a single filename.  All in all, only
     searching the static block here seems best: it's correct and it's
     cleanest.  */

  /* NOTE: carlton/2002-12-05: There's also a possible performance
     issue here: if you usually search for global symbols in the
     current file, then it would be slightly better to search the
     current global block before searching all the symtabs.  But there
     are other factors that have a much greater effect on performance
     than that one, so I don't think we should worry about that for
     now.  */
