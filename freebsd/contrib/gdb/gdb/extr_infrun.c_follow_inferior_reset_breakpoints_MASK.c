     step_resumes are a form of bp that are made to be per-thread.

     was being debugged, and now are switching to the child process,
     from the breakpoint package's viewpoint, that's a switch of
     "threads".  We must update the bp's notion of which thread
     it is for, or it'll be ignored when it triggers.  */
