  /*
   * This function is getting ALMOST long enough to break up into several.
   * Here is some rationale:
   *
   * NEW_PROC_API (Solaris 2.6, Solaris 2.7, Unixware):
   *   There are several file descriptors that may need to be open
   *   for any given process or LWP.  The ones we're intereted in are:
   *     - control	 (ctl)	  write-only	change the state
   *     - status	 (status) read-only	query the state
   *     - address space (as)     read/write	access memory
   *     - map           (map)    read-only     virtual addr map
   *   Most of these are opened lazily as they are needed.
   *   The pathnames for the 'files' for an LWP look slightly
   *   different from those of a first-class process:
   *     Pathnames for a process (<proc-id>):
   *       /proc/<proc-id>/ctl
   *       /proc/<proc-id>/status
   *       /proc/<proc-id>/as
   *       /proc/<proc-id>/map
   *     Pathnames for an LWP (lwp-id):
   *       /proc/<proc-id>/lwp/<lwp-id>/lwpctl
   *       /proc/<proc-id>/lwp/<lwp-id>/lwpstatus
   *   An LWP has no map or address space file descriptor, since
   *   the memory map and address space are shared by all LWPs.
   *
   * Everyone else (Solaris 2.5, Irix, OSF)
   *   There is only one file descriptor for each process or LWP.
   *   For convenience, we copy the same file descriptor into all
   *   three fields of the procinfo struct (ctl_fd, status_fd, and
   *   as_fd, see NEW_PROC_API above) so that code that uses them
   *   doesn't need any #ifdef's.
   *     Pathname for all:
   *       /proc/<proc-id>
   *
   *   Solaris 2.5 LWP's:
   *     Each LWP has an independent file descriptor, but these
   *     are not obtained via the 'open' system call like the rest:
   *     instead, they're obtained thru an ioctl call (PIOCOPENLWP)
   *     to the file descriptor of the parent process.
   *
   *   OSF threads:
   *     These do not even have their own independent file descriptor.
   *     All operations are carried out on the file descriptor of the
   *     parent process.  Therefore we just call open again for each
   *     thread, getting a new handle for the same 'file'.
   */

#ifdef NEW_PROC_API
  /*
   * In this case, there are several different file descriptors that
   * we might be asked to open.  The control file descriptor will be
   * opened early, but the others will be opened lazily as they are
   * needed.
