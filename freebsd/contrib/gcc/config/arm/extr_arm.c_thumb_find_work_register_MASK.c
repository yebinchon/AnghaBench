     we could just check current_function_args_size to see how many bytes are

     Sometimes it will have the value 0 when in fact arguments are being
     passed.  (See testcase execute/20021111-1.c for an example).  So we also
     check the args_info.nregs field as well.  The problem with this field is
     that it makes no allowances for arguments that are passed to the
