	 parameters have default arguments.

	 what constructor to use during overload resolution.  Since
	 overload resolution will never prefer such a constructor to
	 the non-template copy constructor (which is either explicitly
	 or implicitly defined), there's no need to worry about their
	 existence.  Theoretically, they should never even be
	 instantiated, but that's hard to forestall.  */
