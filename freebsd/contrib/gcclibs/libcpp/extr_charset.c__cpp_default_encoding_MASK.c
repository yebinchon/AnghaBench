  /* We disable this because the default codeset is 7-bit ASCII on
     most platforms, and this causes conversion failures on every
     file in GCC that happens to have one of the upper 128 characters
     in it -- most likely, as part of the name of a contributor.
     We should definitely recognize in-band markers of file encoding,
     like:
     - the appropriate Unicode byte-order mark (FE FF) to recognize
       UTF16 and UCS4 (in both big-endian and little-endian flavors)
       and UTF8
     - a "#i", "#d", "/ *", "//", " #p" or "#p" (for #pragma) to
       distinguish ASCII and EBCDIC.
     - now we can parse something like "#pragma GCC encoding <xyz>
       on the first line, or even Emacs/VIM's mode line tags (there's
       a problem here in that VIM uses the last line, and Emacs has
       its more elaborate "local variables" convention).
     - investigate whether Java has another common convention, which
       would be friendly to support.
