     The trickiest bit here is that the LinuxThreads pthread_manager thread
     should *always* be considered to be reentrant, so that none of our 
     hooks actually do anything.  Why?  Because that thread isn't a real
     thread from the point of view of the thread library, and so lots of
     stuff isn't initialized, leading to SEGV very quickly.  Even calling
     pthread_self is a bit suspect, but it happens to work.  */
