    // The data stream seen by the last LED in the chain will be delayed by
    // (count - 1) clock edges, because each LED before it inverts the clock
    // line and delays the data by one clock edge.  Therefore, to make sure
    // the last LED actually receives the data we wrote, the number of extra
    // edges we send at the end of the frame must be at least (count - 1).
    // For the APA102C, that is sufficient.
    //
    // The SK9822 only updates after it sees 32 zero bits followed by one more
    // rising edge.  To avoid having the update time depend on the color of
    // the last LED, we send a dummy 0xFF byte.  (Unfortunately, this means
    // that partial updates of the beginning of an LED strip are not possible;
    // the LED after the last one you are trying to update will be black.)
    // After that, to ensure that the last LED in the chain sees 32 zero bits
    // and a rising edge, we need to send at least 65 + (count - 1) edges.  It
    // is sufficent and simpler to just send (5 + count/16) bytes of zeros.
    //
    // We are ignoring the specification for the end frame in the APA102/SK9822
    // datasheets because it does not actually ensure that all the LEDs will
    // start displaying their new colors right away.
