    //    reset the state in our map and return false. When the user releases the
    //    key, the up event will no longer be masked and the OS will observe the
    //    released key.
    // 3. KC_LOCK was just pressed. In this case, we set up the state machine
    //    to watch for the next key down event, and finish processing
    // 4. The keycode is below 0xFF, and we are watching for new keys. In this case,
    //    we will send the key down event to the os, and set the key_state for that
    //    key to mask the up event.

    //    the user pressed a key that we cannot "lock", as it's a series of keys,
    //    or a macro invocation, or a layer transition, or a custom-defined key, or
