    Purpose
    =======

    DLABAD takes as input the values computed by DLAMCH for underflow and
    overflow, and returns the square root of each of these values if the
    log of LARGE is sufficiently large.  This subroutine is intended to
    identify machines with a large exponent range, such as the Crays, and
    redefine the underflow and overflow limits to be the square roots of
    the values computed by DLAMCH.  This subroutine is needed because
    DLAMCH does not compensate for poor arithmetic in the upper half of
    the exponent range, as is found on a Cray.

    Arguments
    =========

    SMALL   (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION
            On entry, the underflow threshold as computed by DLAMCH.
            On exit, if LOG10(LARGE) is sufficiently large, the square
            root of SMALL, otherwise unchanged.

    LARGE   (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION
            On entry, the overflow threshold as computed by DLAMCH.
            On exit, if LOG10(LARGE) is sufficiently large, the square
            root of LARGE, otherwise unchanged.

    =====================================================================


       If it looks like we're on a Cray, take the square root of
       SMALL and LARGE to avoid overflow and underflow problems.
