	system call (or maximum API call) interrupt priority.  Interrupts that are
	above the maximum system call priority are kept permanently enabled, even
	when the RTOS kernel is in a critical section, but cannot make any calls to
	FreeRTOS API functions.  If configASSERT() is defined in FreeRTOSConfig.h
	then portASSERT_IF_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY_INVALID() will result in an assertion
	failure if a FreeRTOS API function is called from an interrupt that has been
	assigned a priority above the configured maximum system call priority.
	Only FreeRTOS functions that end in FromISR can be called from interrupts
	that have been assigned a priority at or (logically) below the maximum
	system call	interrupt priority.  FreeRTOS maintains a separate interrupt
	safe API to ensure interrupt entry is as fast and as simple as possible.
	More information (albeit Cortex-M specific) is provided on the following
	link: http://www.freertos.org/RTOS-Cortex-M3-M4.html */
