    /* Determine which frames in the buffer qualify for analysis.

       Note that hard telecine always has nb_fields = 2 and
       video TFF = constant (i.e. the stream flags look no different from
       a true interlaced or true progressive stream). Basically, no one ever
       sets the progressive frame flag for the input frames d, e, and a -
       in practice they're all flagged as interlaced.

       A frame may qualify for hard TC analysis if it has no soft field repeat
       (i.e. it cannot be part of a soft telecine). The condition
       nb_fields == 2 must always match.

       Additionally, curr and next must have had motion with respect to the
       previous frame, to ensure that the different field combinations have
       produced unique pictures.

       Alternatively, if there was no motion, but the cadence position was
       reliably detected and it was the expected one, we qualify the frame
       for analysis (mainly, for TFD voting).

       We only proceed with the cadence analysis if all three frames
       in the buffer qualify.
