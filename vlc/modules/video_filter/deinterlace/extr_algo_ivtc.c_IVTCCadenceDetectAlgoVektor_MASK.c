    /* This algorithm is based on detecting hard-repeated fields (by motion
       detection), and conservatively estimating what the seen repeats could
       mean for the cadence position.

       "Conservative" means that we do not rule out possibilities if repeats
       are *not* seen, but only *add* possibilities based on what repeats
       *are* seen. This is important. Otherwise full-frame repeats in the
       original film (8fps or 12fps animation is very common in anime),
       causing spurious field repeats, would mess up the detection.
       With this strategy, spurious repeats will only slow down the lock-on,
       and will not break an existing lock-on once acquired.

       Several possibilities are kept open until the sequence gives enough
       information to make a unique detection. When the sequence becomes
       inconsistent (e.g. bad cut), the detector resets itself.

       The main ideas taken from the TVTime/Xine algorithm are:
        1) Conservatively using information from detected field repeats,
        2) Cadence counting the earlier detection results and combining with
           the new detection result, and
        3) The observation that video TFF/BFF uniquely determines TFD.

       The main differences are
        1) Different motion detection (see EstimateNumBlocksWithMotion()).
           Vektor's original estimates the average top/bottom field diff
           over the last 3 frames, while ours uses a block-based approach
           for diffing and just compares the field diffs between "curr" and
           "next" against each other (see IVTCLowLevelDetect()).
           Both approaches are adaptive, but in a different way.
        2) The specific detection logic used is a bit different (see both
           codes for details; the original is in xine-lib, function
           determine_pulldown_offset_short_history_new() in pulldown.c;
           ours is obviously given below). I think the one given here
           is a bit simpler.

       Note that we don't have to worry about getting a detection in all cases.
       It's enough if we work reliably, say, 99% of the time, and the other 1%
       of the time just admit that we don't know the cadence position.
       (This mostly happens after a bad cut, when the new scene has
       "difficult" motion characteristics, such as repeated film frames.)
       Our frame composer is built to handle also cases where we have no
       reliable detection of the cadence position; see IVTCOutputOrDropFrame().
       More important is to never lock on incorrectly, as this would both
       generate interlacing artifacts where none existed, and cause motion
       to stutter (because duplicate frames would be shown and unique ones
       dropped).
