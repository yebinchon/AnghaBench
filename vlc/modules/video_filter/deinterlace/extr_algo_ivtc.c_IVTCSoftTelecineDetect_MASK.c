    /* Soft telecine can be detected from the flag pattern:
       nb_fields = 3,2,3,2,... and *video* TFF = true, false, false, true
       (TFF telecine) or false, true, true, false (BFF telecine).

       We don't particularly care which field goes first, because in soft TC
       we're working with progressive frames. And in any case, the video FDs
       of successive frames must match any field repeats in order for field
       renderers (such as traditional DVD player + CRT TV) to work correctly.
       Thus the video TFF/BFF flag provides no additional useful information
       for us on top of checking nb_fields.

       The only thing to *do* to soft telecine in an IVTC filter is to even
       out the outgoing PTS diffs to 2.5 fields each, so that we get
       a steady 24fps output. Thus, we can do this processing even if it turns
       out that we saw a lone field repeat (which are also sometimes used,
       such as in the Silent Mobius OP and in Sol Bianca). We can be aggressive
       and don't need to care about false positives - as long as we are equally
       aggressive about dropping out of soft telecine mode the moment a "2" is
       followed by another "2" and not a "3" as in soft TC.

       Finally, we conclude that the one-frame future buffer is enough for us
       to make soft TC decisions just in time for rendering the frame in the
       "current" position. The flag patterns given below constitute proof
       of this property.

       Soft telecine is relatively rare at least in anime, but it exists;
       e.g. Angel Links OP, Silent Mobius, and Stellvia of the Universe have
       sequences that are soft telecined. Stellvia, especially, alternates
       between soft and hard telecine all the time.
