    "The `Box` type is another wrapper around a C pointer with one additional "
    "behaviour as compared to `Ref`. When a `Box` object is deleted it will "
    "also call `del` on the object it points to. The means a `Box` is "
    "considered a pointer type that _owns_ the object it points to, and so is "
    "responsible for it's destruction. Due to this `Box`s must point to valid "
    "Cello objects and so can't be initalised with `NULL` or anything else "
