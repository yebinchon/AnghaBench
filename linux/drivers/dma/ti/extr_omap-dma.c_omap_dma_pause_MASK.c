	 * We do not allow DMA_MEM_TO_DEV transfers to be paused.
	 * From the AM572x TRM, 16.1.4.18 Disabling a Channel During Transfer:
	 * "When a channel is disabled during a transfer, the channel undergoes
	 * an abort, unless it is hardware-source-synchronized â€¦".
	 * A source-synchronised channel is one where the fetching of data is
	 * under control of the device. In other words, a device-to-memory
	 * transfer. So, a destination-synchronised channel (which would be a
	 * memory-to-device transfer) undergoes an abort if the the CCR_ENABLE
	 * bit is cleared.
	 * From 16.1.4.20.4.6.2 Abort: "If an abort trigger occurs, the channel
	 * aborts immediately after completion of current read/write
	 * transactions and then the FIFO is cleaned up." The term "cleaned up"
	 * is not defined. TI recommends to check that RD_ACTIVE and WR_ACTIVE
	 * are both clear _before_ disabling the channel, otherwise data loss
	 * will occur.
	 * The problem is that if the channel is active, then device activity
	 * can result in DMA activity starting between reading those as both
	 * clear and the write to DMA_CCR to clear the enable bit hitting the
	 * hardware. If the DMA hardware can't drain the data in its FIFO to the
	 * destination, then data loss "might" occur (say if we write to an UART
	 * and the UART is not accepting any further data).
