	 * Do not perform queue merging if the device is non
	 * rotational and performs internal queueing. In fact, such a
	 * device reaches a high speed through internal parallelism
	 * and pipelining. This means that, to reach a high
	 * throughput, it must have many requests enqueued at the same
	 * time. But, in this configuration, the internal scheduling
	 * algorithm of the device does exactly the job of queue
	 * merging: it reorders requests so as to obtain as much as
	 * possible a sequential I/O pattern. As a consequence, with
	 * the workload generated by processes doing interleaved I/O,
	 * the throughput reached by the device is likely to be the
	 * same, with and without queue merging.
	 *
	 * Disabling merging also provides a remarkable benefit in
	 * terms of throughput. Merging tends to make many workloads
	 * artificially more uneven, because of shared queues
	 * remaining non empty for incomparably more time than
	 * non-merged queues. This may accentuate workload
	 * asymmetries. For example, if one of the queues in a set of
	 * merged queues has a higher weight than a normal queue, then
	 * the shared queue may inherit such a high weight and, by
	 * staying almost always active, may force BFQ to perform I/O
	 * plugging most of the time. This evidently makes it harder
	 * for BFQ to let the device reach a high throughput.
	 *
	 * Finally, the likely() macro below is not used because one
	 * of the two branches is more likely than the other, but to
	 * have the code path after the following if() executed as
	 * fast as possible for the case of a non rotational device
	 * with queueing. We want it because this is the fastest kind
	 * of device. On the opposite end, the likely() may lengthen
	 * the execution time of BFQ for the case of slower devices
	 * (rotational or at least without queueing). But in this case
	 * the execution time of BFQ matters very little, if not at
	 * all.

	 * for KVM/QEMU and dump I/O threads. Basing on this
