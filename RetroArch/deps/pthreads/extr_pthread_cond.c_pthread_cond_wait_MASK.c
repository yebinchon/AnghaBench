    * DOCPUBLIC
    *      This function waits on a condition variable until
    *      awakened by a signal or broadcast.
    *
    *      Caller MUST be holding the mutex lock; the
    *      lock is released and the caller is blocked waiting
    *      on 'cond'. When 'cond' is signaled, the mutex
    *      is re-acquired before returning to the caller.
    *
    * PARAMETERS
    *      cond
    *              pointer to an instance of pthread_cond_t
    *
    *      mutex
    *              pointer to an instance of pthread_mutex_t
    *
    *
    * DESCRIPTION
    *      This function waits on a condition variable until
    *      awakened by a signal or broadcast.
    *
    *      NOTES:
    *
    *      1)      The function must be called with 'mutex' LOCKED
    *              by the calling thread, or undefined behaviour
    *              will result.
    *
    *      2)      This routine atomically releases 'mutex' and causes
    *              the calling thread to block on the condition variable.
    *              The blocked thread may be awakened by
    *                      pthread_cond_signal or
    *                      pthread_cond_broadcast.
    *
    * Upon successful completion, the 'mutex' has been locked and
    * is owned by the calling thread.
    *
    *
    * RESULTS
    *              0               caught condition; mutex released,
    *              EINVAL          'cond' or 'mutex' is invalid,
    *              EINVAL          different mutexes for concurrent waits,
    *              EINVAL          mutex is not held by the calling thread,
    *
