    * Win32 Critical Sections rather than Win32 Mutexes.
    *
    * If using a single global lock slows applications down too much,
    * multiple global locks could be created and hashed on some random
    * value associated with each mutex, the pointer perhaps. At a guess,
    * a good value for the optimal number of global locks might be
    * the number of processors + 1.
