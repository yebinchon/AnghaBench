   /* This is very complex because recreating condition variable semantics
    * with Win32 parts is not easy.
    *
    * The main problem is that a condition variable can't be used to
    * "pre-wake" a thread (it will get wakened only after it's waited).
    *
    * Whereas a win32 event can pre-wake a thread (the event will be set
    * in advance, so a 'waiter' won't even have to wait on it).
    *
    * Keep in mind a condition variable can apparently pre-wake a thread,
    * insofar as spurious wakeups are always possible,
    * but nobody will be expecting this and it does not need to be simulated.
    *
    * Moreover, we won't be doing this, because it counts as a spurious wakeup
    * -- someone else with a genuine claim must get wakened, in any case.
    *
    * Therefore we choose to wake only one of the correct waiting threads.
    * So at the very least, we need to do something clever. But there's
    * bigger problems.
    * We don't even have a straightforward way in win32 to satisfy
    * pthread_cond_wait's atomicity requirement. The bulk of this
    * algorithm is solving that.
    *
    * Note: We might could simplify this using vista+ condition variables,
    * but we wanted an XP compatible solution. */
