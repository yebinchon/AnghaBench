	 * data accumulated, this "slow start" keeps us from
	 * dumping all that data as back-to-back packets (which
	 * might overwhelm an intermediate gateway).
	 *
	 * There are two phases to the opening: Initially we
	 * open by one mss on each ack.  This makes the window
	 * size increase exponentially with time.  If the
	 * window is larger than the path can handle, this
	 * exponential growth results in dropped packet(s)
	 * almost immediately.  To get more time between
	 * drops but still "push" the network to take advantage
	 * of improving conditions, we switch from exponential
	 * to linear window opening at some threshhold size.
	 * For a threshhold, we use half the current window
	 * size, truncated to a multiple of the mss.
	 *
	 * (the minimum cwnd that will give us exponential
	 * growth is 2 mss.  We don't allow the threshhold
	 * to go below this.)
