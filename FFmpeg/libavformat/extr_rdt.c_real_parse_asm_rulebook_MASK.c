     * end so we can use it as delimiter.
     * Every rule occurs twice, once for when the RTSP packet header marker
     * is set and once for if it isn't. We only read the first because we
     * don't care much (that's what the "odd" variable is for).
     * Each rule contains a set of one or more statements, optionally
     * preceded by a single condition. If there's a condition, the rule
     * starts with a '#'. Multiple conditions are merged between brackets,
     * so there are never multiple conditions spread out over separate
     * statements. Generally, these conditions are bitrate limits (min/max)
     * for multi-bitrate streams.
