     * Rough steps for a first boot, when encryption and secure boot are both disabled:
     *   1) Generate secure boot key and write to EFUSE.
     *   2) Write plaintext digest based on plaintext bootloader
     *   3) Generate flash encryption key and write to EFUSE.
     *   4) Encrypt flash in-place including bootloader, then digest,
     *      then app partitions and other encrypted partitions
     *   5) Burn EFUSE to enable flash encryption (FLASH_CRYPT_CNT)
     *   6) Burn EFUSE to enable secure boot (ABS_DONE_0)
     *
     * If power failure happens during Step 1, probably the next boot will continue from Step 2.
     * There is some small chance that EFUSEs will be part-way through being written so will be
     * somehow corrupted here. Thankfully this window of time is very small, but if that's the
     * case, one has to use the espefuse tool to manually set the remaining bits and enable R/W
     * protection. Once the relevant EFUSE bits are set and R/W protected, Step 1 will be skipped
     * successfully on further reboots.
     *
     * If power failure happens during Step 2, Step 1 will be skipped and Step 2 repeated:
     * the digest will get re-written on the next boot.
     *
     * If power failure happens during Step 3, it's possible that EFUSE was partially written
     * with the generated flash encryption key, though the time window for that would again
     * be very small. On reboot, Step 1 will be skipped and Step 2 repeated, though, Step 3
     * may fail due to the above mentioned reason, in which case, one has to use the espefuse
     * tool to manually set the remaining bits and enable R/W protection. Once the relevant EFUSE
     * bits are set and R/W protected, Step 3 will be skipped successfully on further reboots.
     *
     * If power failure happens after start of 4 and before end of 5, the next boot will fail
     * (bootloader header is encrypted and flash encryption isn't enabled yet, so it looks like
     * noise to the ROM bootloader). The check in the ROM is pretty basic so if the first byte of
     * ciphertext happens to be the magic byte E9 then it may try to boot, but it will definitely
     * crash (no chance that the remaining ciphertext will look like a valid bootloader image).
     * Only solution is to reflash with all plaintext and the whole process starts again: skips
     * Step 1, repeats Step 2, skips Step 3, etc.
     *
     * If power failure happens after 5 but before 6, the device will reboot with flash
     * encryption on and will regenerate an encrypted digest in Step 2. This should still
     * be valid as the input data for the digest is read via flash cache (so will be decrypted)
     * and the code in secure_boot_generate() tells bootloader_flash_write() to encrypt the data
     * on write if flash encryption is enabled. Steps 3 - 5 are skipped (encryption already on),
     * then Step 6 enables secure boot.
