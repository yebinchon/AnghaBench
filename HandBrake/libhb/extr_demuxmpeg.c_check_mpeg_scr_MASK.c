     * This section of code implements the timing model of
     * the "Standard Target Decoder" (STD) of the MPEG2 standard
     * (specified in ISO 13818-1 sections 2.4.2, 2.5.2 & Annex D).
     * The STD removes and corrects for clock discontinuities so
     * that the time stamps on the video, audio & other media
     * streams can be used for cross-media synchronization. To do
     * this the STD has its own timestamp value, the System Clock
     * Reference or SCR, in the PACK header. Clock discontinuities
     * are detected using the SCR & and the adjustment needed
     * to correct post-discontinuity timestamps to be contiguous
     * with pre-discontinuity timestamps is computed from pre- and
     * post-discontinuity values of the SCR. Then this adjustment
     * is applied to every media timestamp (PTS).
     *
     * ISO 13818-1 says there must be an SCR at least every 700ms
     * (100ms for Transport Streams) so if the difference between
     * this SCR & the previous is >700ms it's a discontinuity.
     * If the difference is negative it's non-physical (time doesn't
     * go backward) and must also be a discontinuity. When we find a
     * discontinuity we adjust the scr_offset so that the SCR of the
     * new packet lines up with that of the previous packet.
