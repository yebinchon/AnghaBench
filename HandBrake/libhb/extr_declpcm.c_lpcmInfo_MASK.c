     * LPCM packets have a 7 byte header (the substream id is stripped off
     * before we get here so it's numbered -1 below)::
     * byte -1  Substream id
     * byte 0   Number of frames that begin in this packet
     *          (last frame may finish in next packet)
     * byte 1,2 offset to first frame that begins in this packet (not including hdr)
     * byte 3:
     *   bits 0-4  continuity counter (increments modulo 20)
     *   bit   5   reserved
     *   bit   6   audio mute on/off
     *   bit   7   audio emphasis on/off
     * byte 4:
     *   bits 0-2  #channels - 1 (e.g., stereo = 1)
     *   bit   3   reserved
     *   bits 4-5  sample rate (0=48K,1=96K,2=44.1K,3=32K)
     *   bits 6-7  bits per sample (0=16 bit, 1=20 bit, 2=24 bit)
     * byte 5   Dynamic range control (0x80 = off)
     *
     * The audio is viewed as "frames" of 150 90KHz ticks each (80 samples @ 48KHz).
     * The frames are laid down continuously without regard to MPEG packet
     * boundaries. E.g., for 48KHz stereo, the first packet will contain 6
     * frames plus the start of the 7th, the second packet will contain the
     * end of the 7th, 8-13 & the start of 14, etc. The frame structure is
     * important because the PTS on the packet gives the time of the first
     * frame that starts in the packet *NOT* the time of the first sample
     * in the packet. Also samples get split across packet boundaries
     * so we can't assume that we can consume all the data in one packet
     * on every call to the work routine.
