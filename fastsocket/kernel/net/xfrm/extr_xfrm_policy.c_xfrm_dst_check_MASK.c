	 *
	 *	XFRM dst A --> IPv4 dst X
	 *
	 * X is the "xdst->route" of A (X is also the "dst->path" of A
	 * in this example).  If X is marked obsolete, "A" will not
	 * notice.  That's what we are validating here via the
	 * stale_bundle() check.
	 *
	 * When a policy's bundle is pruned, we dst_free() the XFRM
	 * dst which causes it's ->obsolete field to be set to a
	 * positive non-zero integer.  If an XFRM dst has been pruned
	 * like this, we want to force a new route lookup.
