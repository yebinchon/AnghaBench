	 * It appears there is an erratum which affects at least version 0x11
	 * of I/O APIC (that's the 82093AA and cores integrated into various
	 * chipsets).  Under certain conditions a level-triggered interrupt is
	 * erroneously delivered as edge-triggered one but the respective IRR
	 * bit gets set nevertheless.  As a result the I/O unit expects an EOI
	 * message but it will never arrive and further interrupts are blocked
	 * from the source.  The exact reason is so far unknown, but the
	 * phenomenon was observed when two consecutive interrupt requests
	 * from a given source get delivered to the same CPU and the source is
	 * temporarily disabled in between.
	 *
	 * A workaround is to simulate an EOI message manually.  We achieve it
	 * by setting the trigger mode to edge and then to level when the edge
	 * trigger mode gets detected in the TMR of a local APIC for a
	 * level-triggered interrupt.  We mask the source for the time of the
	 * operation to prevent an edge-triggered interrupt escaping meanwhile.
	 * The idea is from Manfred Spraul.  --macro
	 *
	 * Also in the case when cpu goes offline, fixup_irqs() will forward
	 * any unhandled interrupt on the offlined cpu to the new cpu
	 * destination that is handling the corresponding interrupt. This
	 * interrupt forwarding is done via IPI's. Hence, in this case also
	 * level-triggered io-apic interrupt will be seen as an edge
	 * interrupt in the IRR. And we can't rely on the cpu's EOI
	 * to be broadcasted to the IO-APIC's which will clear the remoteIRR
	 * corresponding to the level-triggered interrupt. Hence on IO-APIC's
	 * supporting EOI register, we do an explicit EOI to clear the
	 * remote IRR and on IO-APIC's which don't have an EOI register,
	 * we use the above logic (mask+edge followed by unmask+level) from
	 * Manfred Spraul to clear the remote IRR.

		 *
		 * To prevent this scenario we read the Remote IRR bit

		 * with masking the ioapic entry and then polling until
		 * Remote IRR was clear before reprogramming the
		 * ioapic I don't trust the Remote IRR bit to be
		 * completey accurate.
		 *
		 * However there appears to be no other way to plug

		 * accurate and is causing problems then it is a hardware bug
