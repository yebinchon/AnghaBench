	 * With get_user_pages_fast, we walk down the pagetables without taking
	 * any locks.  For this we would like to load the pointers atoimcally,
	 * but that is not possible (without expensive cmpxchg8b) on PAE.  What
	 * we do have is the guarantee that a pte will only either go from not
	 * present to present, or present to not present or both -- it will not
	 * switch to a completely different present page without a TLB flush in
	 * between; something that we are blocking by holding interrupts off.
	 *
	 * Setting ptes from not present to present goes:
	 * ptep->pte_high = h;
	 * smp_wmb();
	 * ptep->pte_low = l;
	 *
	 * And present to not present goes:
	 * ptep->pte_low = 0;
	 * smp_wmb();
	 * ptep->pte_high = 0;
	 *
	 * We must ensure here that the load of pte_low sees l iff pte_high
	 * sees h. We load pte_high *after* loading pte_low, which ensures we
	 * don't see an older value of pte_high.  *Then* we recheck pte_low,
	 * which ensures that we haven't picked up a changed pte high. We might
	 * have got rubbish values from pte_low and pte_high, but we are
	 * guaranteed that pte_low will not have the present bit set *unless*
	 * it is 'l'. And get_user_pages_fast only operates on present ptes, so
	 * we're safe.
	 *
	 * gup_get_pte should not be used or copied outside gup.c without being
	 * very careful -- it does not atomically load the pte or anything that
	 * is likely to be useful for you.
