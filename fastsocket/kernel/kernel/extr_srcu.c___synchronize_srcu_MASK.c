	 *
	 *	Despite what you might think at first glance, the

	 *	critical section ended by the following mutex_unlock().
	 *	Otherwise, a task taking the early exit can race
	 *	with a srcu_read_unlock(), which might have executed
	 *	just before the preceding srcu_readers_active() check,
	 *	and whose CPU might have reordered the srcu_read_unlock()
	 *	with the preceding critical section.  In this case, there
	 *	is nothing preventing the synchronize_sched() task that is
	 *	taking the early exit from freeing a data structure that
	 *	is still being referenced (out of order) by the task
	 *	doing the srcu_read_unlock().
	 *
	 *	Alternatively, the comparison with "2" on the early exit
	 *	could be changed to "3", but this increases synchronize_srcu()
	 *	latency for bulk loads.  So the current code is preferred.
