	 * ensure that) so we have a list with a single bio.
	 * We pretend that we have just taken it off a longer list, so
	 * we assign bio_list to the next (which is NULL) and bio_tail
	 * to &bio_list, thus initialising the bio_list of new bios to be
	 * added.  __generic_make_request may indeed add some more bios
	 * through a recursive call to generic_make_request.  If it
	 * did, we find a non-NULL value in bio_list and re-enter the loop
	 * from the top.  In this case we really did just take the bio
	 * of the top of the list (no pretending) and so fixup bio_list and
	 * bio_tail or bi_next, and call into __generic_make_request again.
	 *
	 * The loop was structured like this to make only one call to
	 * __generic_make_request (which is important as it is large and
	 * inlined) and to keep the structure simple.
