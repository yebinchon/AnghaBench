	 * up before it dispatched the vblank swap (since the lock has to be
	 * held while touching the ringbuffer), in which case the client would
	 * clear and start the next frame before the swap occurred, and
	 * flicker would occur in addition to likely missing the vblank.
	 *
	 * In the absence of this ioctl, userland falls back to a correct path
	 * of waiting for a vblank, then dispatching the swap on its own.
	 * Context switching to userland and back is plenty fast enough for
	 * meeting the requirements of vblank swapping.
