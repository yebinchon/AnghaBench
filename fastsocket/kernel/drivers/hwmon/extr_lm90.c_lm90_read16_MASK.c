	 * inbetween the readings. The datasheet says we should either use
	 * the one-shot conversion register, which we don't want to do
	 * (disables hardware monitoring) or monitor the busy bit, which is
	 * impossible (we can't read the values and monitor that bit at the
	 * exact same time). So the solution used here is to read the high
	 * byte once, then the low byte, then the high byte again. If the new
	 * high byte matches the old one, then we have a valid reading. Else
	 * we have to read the low byte again, and now we believe we have a
	 * correct reading.
