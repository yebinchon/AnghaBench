   /* NOTES:
      The RAM area starts at 0x1f00 from the bios_base address.

      For BIOS Version 2.0:
      
      The drive parameter table seems to start at 0x1f30.
      The first byte's purpose is not known.
      Next is the cylinder, head, and sector information.
      The last 4 bytes appear to be the drive's size in sectors.
      The other bytes in the drive parameter table are unknown.
      If anyone figures them out, please send me mail, and I will
      update these notes.

      Tape drives do not get placed in this table.

      There is another table at 0x1fea:
      If the byte is 0x01, then the SCSI ID is not in use.
      If the byte is 0x18 or 0x48, then the SCSI ID is in use,
      although tapes don't seem to be in this table.  I haven't
      seen any other numbers (in a limited sample).

      0x1f2d is a drive count (i.e., not including tapes)

      The table at 0x1fcc are I/O ports addresses for the various
      operations.  I calculate these by hand in this driver code.

      
      
      For the ISA-200S version of BIOS Version 2.0:

      The drive parameter table starts at 0x1f33.

      WARNING: Assume that the table entry is 25 bytes long.  Someone needs
      to check this for the Quantum ISA-200S card.

      
      
      For BIOS Version 3.2:

      The drive parameter table starts at 0x1f70.  Each entry is
      0x0a bytes long.  Heads are one less than we need to report.

	    only uses the absolute sector data.  Recent versions of Linux's
	    fdisk(1) will fill this data in correctly, and forthcoming

	    Checking for a non-zero partition type is not part of the
