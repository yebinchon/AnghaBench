	/* Now it's time to program the FIFO threshold, basically the
	 * number of samples the card will buffer before it interrupts
	 * the CPU.
	 *
	 * If we don't have a stop count, then use half the size of
	 * the FIFO (the manufacturer's recommendation).  Consider
	 * that the FIFO can hold 2K samples (4K bytes).  With the
	 * threshold set at half the FIFO size, we have a margin of
	 * error of 1024 samples.  At the chip's maximum sample rate
	 * of 100,000 Hz, the CPU would have to delay interrupt
	 * service for a full 10 milliseconds in order to lose data
	 * here (as opposed to higher up in the kernel).  I've never
	 * seen it happen.  However, for slow sample rates it may
	 * buffer too much data and introduce too much delay for the
	 * user application.
	 *
	 * If we have a stop count, then things get more interesting.
	 * If the stop count is less than the FIFO size (actually
	 * three-quarters of the FIFO size - see below), we just use
	 * the stop count itself as the threshold, the card interrupts
	 * us when that many samples have been taken, and we kill the
	 * acquisition at that point and are done.  If the stop count
	 * is larger than that, then we divide it by 2 until it's less
	 * than three quarters of the FIFO size (we always leave the
	 * top quarter of the FIFO as protection against sluggish CPU
	 * interrupt response) and use that as the threshold.  So, if
	 * the stop count is 4000 samples, we divide by two twice to
	 * get 1000 samples, use that as the threshold, take four
	 * interrupts to get our 4000 samples and are done.
	 *
	 * The algorithm could be more clever.  For example, if 81000
	 * samples are requested, we could set the threshold to 1500
	 * samples and take 54 interrupts to get 81000.  But 54 isn't
	 * a power of two, so this algorithm won't find that option.
	 * Instead, it'll set the threshold at 1266 and take 64
	 * interrupts to get 81024 samples, of which the last 24 will
	 * be discarded... but we won't get the last interrupt until
	 * they've been collected.  To find the first option, the
	 * computer could look at the prime decomposition of the
	 * sample count (81000 = 3^4 * 5^3 * 2^3) and factor it into a
	 * threshold (1500 = 3 * 5^3 * 2^2) and an interrupt count (54
	 * = 3^3 * 2).  Hmmm... a one-line while loop or prime
	 * decomposition of integers... I'll leave it the way it is.
	 *
	 * I'll also note a mini-race condition before ignoring it in
	 * the code.  Let's say we're taking 4000 samples, as before.
	 * After 1000 samples, we get an interrupt.  But before that
	 * interrupt is completely serviced, another sample is taken
	 * and loaded into the FIFO.  Since the interrupt handler
	 * empties the FIFO before returning, it will read 1001 samples.
	 * If that happens four times, we'll end up taking 4004 samples,
	 * not 4000.  The interrupt handler will discard the extra four
	 * samples (by halting the acquisition with four samples still
	 * in the FIFO), but we will have to wait for them.
	 *
	 * In short, this code works pretty well, but for either of
	 * the two reasons noted, might end up waiting for a few more
	 * samples than actually requested.  Shouldn't make too much
	 * of a difference.
