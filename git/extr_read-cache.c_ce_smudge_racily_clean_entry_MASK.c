		 * in index is the 6-byte file but the cached stat information
		 * becomes zero --- which would then match what we would
		 * obtain from the filesystem next time we stat("frotz").
		 *
		 * However, the second update-index, before calling
		 * this function, notices that the cached size is 6
		 * bytes and what is on the filesystem is an empty
		 * file, and never calls us, so the cached size information
		 * for "frotz" stays 6 which does not match the filesystem.
