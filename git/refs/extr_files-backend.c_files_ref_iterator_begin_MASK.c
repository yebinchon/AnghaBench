	 * `prime_ref` argument set to true. This causes the loose
	 * references in the subtree to be pre-read into the cache.
	 * (If they've already been read, that's OK; we only need to
	 * guarantee that they're read before the packed refs, not
	 * *how much* before.) After that, we call
	 * packed_ref_iterator_begin(), which internally checks

	 * this case. So ask the packed_ref_store for all of its
