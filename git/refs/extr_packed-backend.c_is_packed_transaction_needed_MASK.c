	 * old values are not being checked, and the old `packed-refs`
	 * file doesn't contain any of those reference(s). This gives
	 * false positives for some other cases that could
	 * theoretically be optimized away:
	 *
	 * 1. It could be that the old value is being verified without
	 *    setting a new value. In this case, we could verify the
	 *    old value here and skip the update if it agrees. If it
	 *    disagrees, we could either let the update go through
	 *    (the actual commit would re-detect and report the
	 *    problem), or come up with a way of reporting such an
	 *    error to *our* caller.
	 *
	 * 2. It could be that a new value is being set, but that it
	 *    is identical to the current packed value of the
	 *    reference.
	 *
	 * Neither of these cases will come up in the current code,
	 * because the only caller of this function passes to it a
	 * transaction that only includes `delete` updates with no
	 * `old_id`. Even if that ever changes, false positives only
	 * cause an optimization to be missed; they do not affect
