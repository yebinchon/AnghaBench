	 * If we are TREESAME to a marked-for-deletion parent, but not to any
	 * unmarked parents, unmark the first TREESAME parent. This is the
	 * parent that the default simplify_history==1 scan would have followed,
	 * and it doesn't make sense to omit that path when asking for a
	 * simplified full history. Retaining it improves the chances of
	 * understanding odd missed merges that took an old version of a file.
	 *
	 * Example:
	 *
	 *   I--------*X       A modified the file, but mainline merge X used
	 *    \       /        "-s ours", so took the version from I. X is
	 *     `-*A--'         TREESAME to I and !TREESAME to A.
	 *
	 * Default log from X would produce "I". Without this check,
	 * --full-history --simplify-merges would produce "I-A-X", showing
	 * the merge commit X and that it changed A, but not making clear that
	 * it had just taken the I version. With this check, the topology above
	 * is retained.
	 *
	 * Note that it is possible that the simplification chooses a different
	 * TREESAME parent from the default, in which case this test doesn't
	 * activate, and we _do_ drop the default parent. Example:
	 *
	 *   I------X         A modified the file, but it was reverted in B,
	 *    \    /          meaning mainline merge X is TREESAME to both
	 *    *A-*B           parents.
	 *
	 * Default log would produce "I" by following the first parent;
	 * --full-history --simplify-merges will produce "I-A-B". But this is a
	 * reasonable result - it presents a logical full history leading from
	 * I to X, and X is not an important merge.
