	 * This next part is a little weird.  We do not want to do an
	 * implicit rename into a directory we renamed on our side, because
	 * that will result in a spurious rename/rename(1to2) conflict.  An
	 * example:
	 *   Base commit: dumbdir/afile, otherdir/bfile
	 *   Side 1:      smrtdir/afile, otherdir/bfile
	 *   Side 2:      dumbdir/afile, dumbdir/bfile
	 * Here, while working on Side 1, we could notice that otherdir was
	 * renamed/merged to dumbdir, and change the diff_filepair for
	 * otherdir/bfile into a rename into dumbdir/bfile.  However, Side
	 * 2 will notice the rename from dumbdir to smrtdir, and do the
	 * transitive rename to move it from dumbdir/bfile to
	 * smrtdir/bfile.  That gives us bfile in dumbdir vs being in
	 * smrtdir, a rename/rename(1to2) conflict.  We really just want
	 * the file to end up in smrtdir.  And the way to achieve that is
	 * to not let Side1 do the rename to dumbdir, since we know that is
	 * the source of one of our directory renames.
	 *
	 * That's why oentry and dir_rename_exclusions is here.
	 *
	 * As it turns out, this also prevents N-way transient rename
	 * confusion; See testcases 9c and 9d of t6043.
